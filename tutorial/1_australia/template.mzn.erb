% Decision variables:
% variables in the sense of mathematical or logical
% variables. Unlike parameters and variables in a standard programming language,
% the modeller does not need to give them a value. Rather the value of a decision
% variable is unknown and it is only when the MiniZinc model is executed that
% the solving system determines if the decision variable can be assigned a value
% that satifies the constraints in the model and if so what this is.
